Today, Bun has two main priorities: **stability** and **compatibility** with `Node.js` and `Web APIs`. 
In v0.3.0, we've made _significant_ progress toward both of these goals.

To Install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

To Upgrade:

```bash
bun upgrade
```

## Stability improvements
- Bun now uses 3-5x less memory under load. Previously, Bun wasn't scheduling garbage collection in coordination with the event loop. (See the benchmark here)

- Bun now has better formatting for console.log() (important for debugging!)
